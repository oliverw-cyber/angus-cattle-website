    <p>
      Black Angus cattle originated in northeastern Scotland in the early 1800s,
      primarily in the counties of Aberdeen, Banff, Kincardine, and Angus.
      Farmers selectively bred native cattle to improve meat quality,
      fertility, and hardiness.
    </p>

    <p>
      The breed became known as Aberdeen Angus and was recognized for its
      naturally polled (hornless) trait, which is genetically dominant.
    </p>

    <p>
      Angus cattle were first imported into the United States in 1873.
      They quickly gained popularity due to their adaptability,
      strong maternal traits, and superior beef quality.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over time, selective breeding programs have improved growth rates,
      feed efficiency, carcass quality, and genetic consistency,
      making Black Angus one of the most influential beef breeds worldwide.
